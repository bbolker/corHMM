## checking vs corHMM

* `use.fog` ?
* `rate.cat` > 1 ?
* when are differences in loglik more likely/bigger? when fit is worse, is it resolved by multi-start? is there a pattern to which parameters differ?

## miscellaneous

* `quiet` option
* return devfun etc etc.? (see main branch of BMB fork)
* priors?
* construct contrasts?
* try HMC/`tmbstan` ...
